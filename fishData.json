These fish are characterized by 4-6 elongated, thread-like rays in the front part of the second dorsal and anal fins. In juveniles the first two of these rays may be four times as long as the fish. Normally, the rays tend to disappear or erode away as the fish grows. The fish also undergoes changes in body shape as it grows. The body of the juvenile fish is short and deep.\nThe spines of the first dorsal fin are visible, though not very prominent at this stage. By the time the fish is 14 inches long, the body is more elongated and the forehead is steeper. In both juveniles and adults the body is strongly compressed. The lateral line arches smoothly but steeply above the pectoral fins. Large specimens are light bluish green above and silvery over most of the remainder of the body.\n",

Similar in appearance to the greater amberjack, the Almaco jack is characterized by a football shaped body and thin forked tail with the body being darker on the top side as well as a white underbelly and a dark line extending from the nose, through the eye, all the way down its flank. The body and lower fins are generally dark brown or dark bluish green, and the lighter-colored belly may look brassy or even lavender. The Almaco jack's dorsal and anal fins are high and elongated, with deeply sickle-shaped outer edges. The nuchal bar in adults is dark-colored, as are the fins, except the pelvic fins, which are white on the ventral side. Almaco jacks typically have less elongated, more flattened bodies than other species of jacks (140 species of jack have been identified to date). Their dorsal fins also distinguish them from other jacks—the first few rays of the dorsal fin are more than twice as long as the dorsal spines in Almaco jacks, whereas in other jack species the rays are less than twice the length of the dorsal spines. Adults can reach up to 36 inches in length and usually weigh 10-20 lbs, though they may exceed 50 lbs.",

    "identification": "Like all chars, the Arctic char has light colored spots on the body and the leading edges of all the fins on the lower part of the body are milky white. These features set the chars apart from the salmons and trouts, which are the chars’ closest relatives and similar in body shape. There is an adipose fin between the dorsal fin and the tail, and an axillary process (a small bump) at the base of each pelvic fin. Arctic chars have squarish or slightly forked tails.The species most often confused with the Arctic char is an extremely close relative (also a char), the Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma). Often it is virtually impossible to distinguish between the two species except by laboratory analysis and even today there are few scientists who know how to make a positive identification. Even if an individual is thoroughly familiar with all the color variations of all salmonnids occurring in the area, color is not a factor that will distinguish the Arctic char from the Dolly Varden.There have been plenty of erroneous materials published concerning the distribution of each species, and consequently anglers and scientists alike have made many false identifications based on the mistaken belief that only Arctic char or only Dolly Varden occurred in a given area, lake, or river in Alaska. An individual who is familiar with both species may be able to make an identification based on the size of the spots, which are larger in the Arctic char. However, fish returning from the sea are often silvery with no spots at all, making external identification all but impossible. Gill raker counts are the most helpful method of identification. In Canada, Victoria Island (Northwest Territory) char have about 25-30 gill rakers on the first left gill arch. Dolly Varden have 21-22. Arctic char have 40-45 pyloric caeca (worm-like appendages on the pylorus, the section of intestine directly after the stomach), while Dolly Varden have about 30. As in all salmon, trout, and char, both the color of the body and the shape of the head vary considerably in different forms of the fish such as the landlocked, seagoing, and most of all, spawning males which develop a kype (the hook at the end of the snout).",

      "description": "The Arctic char is circumpolar in distribution, occurring around the globe from Maine and New Hampshire in the United States northward across northern Canada, Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, and from northern Russia south to Lake Baikal and Kamchatka as well as in Iceland, Great Britain, Scandinavia, the Alps, and Spitsbergen, among other places. An anadromous species (except where it has become landlocked), the Arctic char always returns from the sea to spawn in fresh water, usually in lakes or quiet pools of rivers over gravel bottom. It spawns in autumn or winter when water temperatures reach 4° C or less. The following list includes additional details on where to catch this fish:",

The back and sides are highly variable in color (ranging from brownish or sandy to gray, yellow, reddish, greenish, or any combination), and mottled with numerous lighter spots. The belly is white, the lateral line is pale, and all the fins are dark.\nLargely omnivorous, they feed on herring, sprat, capelin, sand eels, Irish moss, etc. Many unusual items have also been found in the stomachs of adult cod, including oil cans, a rubber doll, finger rings, clothing, and some very rare deep-sea shells that were previously unknown to science.\n",

      "description": "Spadefish are strong fighters, but tough to hook at times because of their small mouths and finicky nature. Chumming with frozen chopped clams in a weighted wire basket is an excellent way to draw spadefish to a boat. Once to the boat, the real secret of catching spadefish is selecting a hook with small enough dimensions to enable them to be hooked. Clam strips, which resemble one of their favorite foods, jelly fish tentacles, make effective baits but they can also be taken in the chum-line by presenting a fly. Experienced spadefish anglers have discovered that unlike many fish, they tend to bite best on a slack tide.The following list includes common methods and techniques used to catch the Atlantic spadefish: The following are fishing methods used to catch this fish:",

The bigeye tuna has a total of 23-31 gill rakers on the first arch. The margin of the liver is striated and the two dorsal fins are close-set, the first having 13-14 spines and the second, 14-16 rays. The anal fin has 11-15 rays. On either side of the caudal peduncle there is a strong lateral keel between two small keels that are located slightly farther back on the tail. The scales are small except on the anterior corselet. The vent is oval or teardrop shaped, not round as in the albacore. The first dorsal fin is deep yellow and the second dorsal fin and the anal fin are blackish brown or yellow and may be edged with black. The finlets are bright yellow with narrow black edges. The tail does not have a white trailing edge like that of the albacore. Generally, there are no special markings on the body, but some specimens may have vertical rows of whitish spots on the venter.The bigeye tuna and the yellowfin tuna are similar in many respects, but the bigeye’s second dorsal and anal fins never grow as long as those of the yellowfin. In the bigeye tuna the margin of the liver is striated and the right lobe is about the same size as the left lobe. In the yellowfin tuna the liver is smooth and the right lobe is clearly longer than either the left or the middle lobe.",

The surest way to distinguish this fish from the brown or yellow bullheads is by the pectoral fins. In the brown and yellow bullheads the rear edge of the pectoral fin spine is serrated with numerous sharp tooth-like projections, while the black bullhead the serrations are extremely weak or absent altogether. Also, the black bullhead has dark-colored chin barbels which may be gray, black, or black-spotted, and its body and head are deeper and more massive than in the brown or yellow bullheads. The tail fin is squarish (truncate) or slightly emarginate, which will readily distinguish the black bullhead from the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), the white catfish (Ameiurus catus), and the blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), all of which have deeply forked tails.",

    "identification": "The black crappie and the white crappie are most often confused with each other. Despite their common names, both species are the same color (dark olive or black dorsally with silvery sides) and both have spots on the sides.\nHowever, you can easily identify the Black Crappie because the pattern of the spotting is distinctly different. In the black crappie the spots are irregular and scattered while in the white crappie the spots may be more vague and are clearly arranged into 7-9 vertical bars on the sides. Another distinction; the black crappie has 7-8 dorsal spines while the white crappie has only 6, the same number as in its anal fin. In body shape the black crappie’s is somewhat deeper than the white crappie.\n",

      "description": "There are different states where you can catch Black crappie. This fish species is native to most of the eastern half of the U.S., the black crappie has been so extensively transplanted that today it entirely blankets the U.S. and reaches up into southern Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec in Canada. It is only noticeably scarce in a swathe of the Midwest stretching from western Texas up through Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and western Montana, and even these states have black crappies either along their borders or in limited internal areas.\nThe black crappie  inhabits large ponds and shallow areas of lakes, with sandy or muddy bottoms and usually in areas of abundant vegetation. It requires a deeper, clearer, somewhat cooler habitat than does the white crappie.\nThe following list includes places where you can catch black crappie:\n",

The edges of the second dorsal, caudal, and anal fins are also dark black. The black grouper has olive or gray body coloration along with small hexagonal bronze spots on its head and lower side. The borders of the soft dorsal, anal, and caudal fin are black or bluish; sometimes there is an orange edge along the pectoral fins. Juveniles feed mainly on crustaceans, while adult fish prefer smaller baitfish. The black grouper is a large hearty fish with a protruding lower jaw. It has an oblonged body shape and rounded margins on both the dorsal and anal fins. The caudal fin is squared-off, and the dorsal fin has 11 spines and 15-17 rays. The preopercule is rounded without the presence of a notch, which distinguishes it from the gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis). Black groupers can reach up to 52 inches (133 cm) in length and can weigh up to 179 pounds (81 kg). Most of the black grouper that are caught average a little over 2 feet in length (70 cm). They can live over 30 years, but most of the growth occurs during the first ten years of life.The front teeth of the black grouper are well-developed canine teeth. Groupers have several sets of strong, slender teeth that act as raspers. These teeth are not used to tear flesh as with the barracudas and sharks, but rather to prevent small fish from escaping.Black grouper are also protogynous hermaphrodites. This means that all of the species are born as females. Later in life, some of the fish will change from female to male so the population can reproduce. Those black groupers that go through this process do so when they reach about 39 - 48 inches.",

The first dorsal fin is proportionately the lowest of any billfish, usually less than 50 percent of the body depth. The body is laterally compressed rather than rounded, much more so than in similar sized blue marlin.The body is slate blue dorsally, changing abruptly to silvery white below the lateral line. When feeding or leaping, the black marlin may display light blue vertical stripes on the sides (see striped marlin coloration). Slight variations in color cause some specimens to have a silvery haze over the body. In Hawaii this has led to the name silver marlin (once thought to be a separate species).",

This is the only species of Euthynnus that has 37 vertebrae. All others in the species have 39 vertebrae. Each jaw has 20-40 small, conical teeth. Bonitos have fewer and larger conical teeth than the black skipjack and mackerels have flat, triangular teeth.Black skipjacks can be distinguished from similar species by the four or five broad, straight, black stripes which run horizontally along the back and by the dark spots between the pectoral and ventral fins. In live specimens, stripes may be visible on the venter as well as on the back, which has frequently led to confusion from anglers mistaken it for the skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelanis. The stripes on the belly rarely persist long after death in the black skipjack; however they remain prominent in the skipjack tuna long after death.",

There are 30-36 rays in the fin, versus 24-30 rays in the channel catfish and 19-23 rays in the white catfish. Internally, the blue catfish can be identified by the fact that it has three chambers in the swim bladder, whereas the channel catfish has two chambers. All three forked tail species may be almost uniformly pale blue or silvery in color, though white catfish may show a more distinct difference between the bluish black and white belly.

There are 65-73 scales along the lateral line-none on the head. The sides and belly of the fish are bright silver. Parts of the fins and the snout may show a yellowish or dusky color. Their body is long, thin, and fusiform, with a bluntly conical snout. Bonefish are basically schooling fish. The smaller ones can be seen in large schools on the flats. The larger ones tend to form smaller schools or groups. They feed on crabs, shrimps, clams, sea worms, sea urchins, and small fish that inhabit the sandy flats and intertidal areas. They are often seen rooting in the sand, their tails breaking the surface of the shallow water; an action commonly known as trailing. At other times they will plough the bottom stirring up silt and mud, known as mudding. They are powerful and run very fast and hard when hooked. Fishing methods include plug, fly or spin casting from a skiff or while wading on tidal flats, using shrimp, crabs or similar baits. Most bonefish are caught in depths from 6 inches to 10 ft. (15 cm to 3 m).The species begins life looking more like an eel than a fish and undergoes a leptocephalus larval stage during which it grows to a length of about 2 1/2 in. (6.3 cm); then during a period of metamorphosis the eel-like larva shrinks to half its former size. As it shrinks, fins begin to appear, and after 10-12 days the eel has become a 1.5 in. (3.81 cm) miniature bonefish, and begins to grow again. Tarpon and ladyfish undergo similar stages of development.",

The dorsal fin has heavy black vermiculations. The basic color of the back is olive-green to dark brown, lightening to white on the belly. At spawning time, the lower flanks and the belly of the males turn bright orange-red with a black edge on the lower sides. Sea-run specimens turn silvery, often with a light iridescent purplish sheen, and with only the red spots showing. The tail is squarish or only very slightly indented.

It is rarely found in waters exceeding 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), and temperatures of 77-80 degrees Fahrenheit (25-27 degrees Celsius) are fatal. It has been introduced into areas of high elevation throughout most of western North America. Today it can be found in scattered locations from the central portions of the lower Canadian Provinces south almost to Mexico (west of Texas).

In fresh water especially near spawning time, both species are bronze to dark brown in general coloration, with black and (usually) red spots on the body and head. In salt water both species tend to become silvery with fewer black spots and no red spots.Though both often occur in the same areas, they can usually be distinguished without laboratory analysis. In fresh water, brown trouts as a rule, are more heavily spotted than Atlantic salmon and usually a good number of these spots are surrounded by lighter halos. The spots on the shape of Xs or Ys, which is not usually the case in the brown trout. The brown trout also has dark spots on the dorsal and adipose fins and vague spots on the tail, though nothing like the prominent radiating spots on the tail of the rainbow trout. The Atlantic salmon has no clear spots on any of these fins. Also, the brown trout’s tail is squarish or very slightly concave or convex, while the Atlantic salmons tail is slightly forked or indented. In juveniles the difference is much more obvious. The tail is slightly forked in the brown trout and deeply forked in the Atlantic salmon. Otherwise, these parr (young Salmonids) look very much alike with small exceptions. A positive distinction between these two species, usually observed in the laboratory, is that the brown trout has well-developed vomerine teeth in a double zigzag row, while the Atlantic salmon has only a single row of poorly developed vomerine teeth.",

White catfish have 19-23 rays, channel catfish have 24-30, and blue catfish have the longest anal fin with 30-36 rays. Internally, the channel catfish has two chambers in the swim bladder and the blue catfish has three.\n",

Breeding males of the species have large, exposed teeth, which may be the origin of the name “dog salmon,” though it is also said that this name evolved because this species was often fed to sled dogs.These fish average around 5-10 pounds but fish of up to 25 pounds are fairly common.",

During spawning it is known to ascend some rivers for considerable distances with some fish traveling over 1,200 miles. In the MacKenzie River, N.W.T., Canada, chum salmon travel all the way to the mouth of the Hay River and to the rapids below Fort Smith on the Slave River, entering both Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes and traveling through the Northwest Territories to the edge of Alberta, Canada. Like all Pacific salmons, with the exception of landlocked specimens, the chum salmon is anadromous and will spend most of its life in the ocean until spawning time when it enters freshwater rivers.

Also, it generally has pale or white gums and a black mouth (some Great Lakes specimens may have gray or black gums) while the chinook always has black gums and a black mouth.Spawning females change very little. Males tend to turn somewhat darker on the back and duller on the sides. During the spawning run they may also exhibit a red stripe along the sides, like rainbow trout. The males develop a kype, both the upper and lower jaw becoming extended and hooked toward each other so that it becomes impossible to close its mouth.",

The Dolly Varden is usually a coastal species whereas the larger bull trout is found inland in large, cold rivers and lakes draining high, mountainous areas. A greater problem arises in trying to separate Dolly Varden from Arctic char. Much of the published information on the distribution of these species is incorrect and often presupposed that only one species occurred in areas or rivers where it is now believed both species may occur. The two are outwardly almost identical in every respect and to complicate matters, significant variations occurs in both species. The spots on the Dolly Varden are usually smaller than the pupil of the eye, while on the Arctic char they are larger than the pupil. When returning from the sea both species are silvery and lack spots. Arctic char on the average have more gill rakers on the first gill arch (25-30 as opposed to 21-22 in the Dolly Varden) and more pyloric caeca (40-45 as opposed to about 30 in Dolly Varden), but fish with intermediate counts (i.e., 23 or 24 gill rakers and 35 pyloric caeca) are not at all uncommon in either species.",

      "description": "The Dolly Varden is known to occur from the Sea of Japan through the Kuril Islands to Kamchatka, through the Aleutian Islands and around Alaska to the Yukon and Northwest Territories (Canada) in the north and the northwestern United States in the south. Like the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), it is an anadromous fish though some populations are landlocked. The following list includes additional details on where to catch this fish:",

Fishing methods include surf fishing, drifting, or still fishing using live or cut baits. Trolling with baits and lures can also produce good results. Baits and lures include mullet, herring, sauri, garfish, anchovy, squid, cut strip baits, jethead trolling lures, trolling feathers, plastic jigs, and spoons.

    "identification": "Due to its coloration and markings it is considered one of the most beautiful of all freshwater game fishes. It is the only species of Salmonidae in which the parr marks on the sides typically remain prominent throughout life rather than disappearing at an early age. A red streak similar to that of a rainbow trout runs along the sides through the ten or so parr marks. The tail is golden yellow (as is most of the body) and is covered with large black spots that radiate outward toward the edge as in the rainbow, cutthroat, and some other closely related species. Usually the posterior part of the body is heavily spotted. The forward part of the body may have spots above the lateral line on the back and top of the head, but not always. The upper fins are golden yellow and heavily spotted. The lower fins are orangish or reddish with no spots. The dorsal fin and the ventral and anal fins have white tips (in some specimens) that are often separated from the rest of the fin by a broad black line. The sides of the head and throat are a blend of rosy red and golden yellow. When this species is brought down from its high altitude habitat and propagated at low altitudes, it loses its brilliant colors and becomes steely blue.",
    "location": {
      "description": "The golden trout is native only to the upper Kern River basin in Tulare and Kern Counties, California. This trout occurs in clear, cool waters at elevations higher than 6,890 ft. Despite its limited distribution, there are two recognized sub-species of golden trout: Oncorhynchus aguabonita aguabonita, which is confined to the south fork of the Kern River and Golden Trout Creek, and Oncorhynchus aguabonita gilberti, which is confined to the Main Kern and Little Kern Rivers. An area of warm water where the South Fork joins the Kern apparently serves as a natural barrier that keeps the two subspecies apart. Golden trout have been introduced to other areas, including the states of Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming, which have self-sustaining populations. It is believed that most of these populations have hybridized with the cutthroat trout. According to some fisheries scientists, most trout in the Kern River basin are also hybrids of recent origin and the only pure populations of golden trout are those limited to the headwater areas.

The front edge of its head is rounded and unnotched in the center. The scalloped hammerhead grows to 10 feet. The front edge of its head is rounded and notched. Of the lesser known hammerheads, there is S. couardi, a large West African species that resembles S. lewini, and the strange looking S. blochii, whose head lobes often measure 50 percent of the body length and are swept back like the wings of an airplane. The remainder of the species, known as the bonnetheads, are only 3-6 feet long and have very short lobed, shovel shaped heads.It swings its broad, flat head back and forth over the bottom in a scanning pattern, in the same way as one uses a metal detector. Tiny organs called the ampullae of Lorenzini, located in the hammerhead sharks’ head, function as electroreceptors that enable the shark to detect food buried beneath the sand. Stingrays are a favorite food of this species. According to scientist Perry Gilbert, one large hammerhead was found to have 96 stingray barbs imbedded in its jaw, mouth, and head.",

Hog snapper have a laterally compressed body with a high back arch and a large, slightly lunate tail. The first three spines in the dorsal fin are much longer than the rest of the dorsal spines and trail behind the dorsal fin. The name ‘hogfish’ is derived from the species’ elongated, hog-like snout that is used to dig around the bottom substrate for food and prey. The jaws of the hogfish are very strong for the species’ size and contain protruding canine teeth that are used for crushing hard shell prey such as mollusks and crabs.The color patterns of the hogfish vary considerably depending on the specimen’s sex, age and habitat. Most often, the fish will be a combination of white and red and a purple or maroon band will run from the snout of the fish back along the top ridge to the dorsal fin. Males will often have a brighter color pattern than the females and young fish may be pale gray or reddish brown. The caudal and pectoral fins may have a bright yellow outer edge while the inner margins are colored with a dark red pattern.",

Hogfish are widely distributed along the edges of reefs and will form small groups, particularly in areas where gorgonian corals are found. The larger specimens can be found in the middle reef sections while smaller fish tend to patrol the outside portion of the patch reefs.

At sea, it is basically a silvery fish with spotting on the back, upper sides, top of head, and all the fins, including the tail fin. Spawning chinooks are olive brown to purplish or even red and undergo a radical metamorphosis, especially the males which develop a large kype. One way to distinguish the chinook from other species is by its black mouth and gums. The similar looking coho Oncorhynchus kisutch, has a black mouth, but white gums, except in the Great Lakes population where the gums may be gray or black.",

      "description": "It is a member of the Pacific salmon genus Oncorhynchus and is both largest and least abundant of this group. It is endemic to the Pacific and rarely, the Arctic Ocean as well as the Bering Sea, the Okhotsk Sea, the Sea of Japan, and most of the rivers that flow into these waters; from Hokkaido in northern Japan to the Anadyr River in the former U.S.S.R., and from the Ventura River in southern California to Point Hope, Alaska. Since as early as 1872, it has been introduced into other waters around the world including the Great Lakes, Atlantic and Gulf states of the U.S., some areas of Central and South America, Europe, and the South Pacific. These transplanted populations apparently failed due to an inability to maintain spawning levels, with the exceptions of South Island in New Zealand, and to some degree in the Great Lakes. In Chile, more recent transplants have shown hope of becoming established with some chinook returning to spawn. The following list includes additional details on where to catch this fish:",

It has a more deeply forked tail than other chars, and several rows of strong basibranchial teeth which are weak, less numerous, or absent in other chars. It is very large char known to grow over 100 lb.

The siscowet, one of three recognized subspecies, is found in Lake Superior at a depth of 300-600 ft. (91-183 m). It is called a fat by commercial fishermen because the flesh is exceedingly fat and oily compared to the other two subspecies. Of all the chars, it is the least tolerant of salt water and is the only freshwater fish ranging into the far north of Canada and Alaska that has apparently not crossed the Bering Strait.

The mouth is subterminal and the snout protrudes beyond it. Because the head is small in relation to the length of the body, older fish may develop a hump behind the head; thus the name “humpback.” The lake whitefish has more pyloric caeca, 140-222, than either the round, with 50-130, or mountain lakefish which has 50-146. The body is more laterally compressed than the round or mountain whitefish, which belong to a group referred to as “round whitefishes”.",

The longfin mako has a blunter snout and a larger eye than the shortfin and much longer pectoral fins. There is a large, prominent, flattened keel on either side of the caudal peduncle. It can be easily distinguished from all other sharks by its teeth, which are like curved daggers with no cusps at the base or serrations along the razor sharp edges. The front surface is flat and the teeth are curved inward. The back of the shortfin mako is a brilliant blue-gray or cobalt blue and the sides are light blue, changing to snowy white on the belly including the lower jaw. The longfin mako is also blue above with light blue sides, and is white below except for the jaw. In real life encounters, the mako’s colors are the most strikingly beautiful of all the mackerel sharks. After death the colors fade to grayish brown.Makos have been implicated in attacks on humans and are the undisputed leader in attacks on boats. A hooked mako will immediately unleash all its fury, reportedly leaping as high as 30 ft out of the water. It may roll, shake, dive, and charge the boat. It has also been known to bite the boat and occasionally to leap into it, causing severe injuries to the angler and wreaking havoc inside the boat.",

      "description": "Mako sharks are found worldwide in tropical and warm temperate seas. These solitary, pelagic, fast swimming species rarely come in close to shore. The shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, is most often encountered by anglers as it is more likely to move in-shore on occasion. The longfin mako, Isurus paucus, is a widely distributed offshore species considered rare in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, except along the coast of Cuba.

Adult cuberas however, are among the very largest of snapper species, obtaining lengths as great as 5 feet and weights of 125lbs and such specimens are not likely to be confused for the smaller mangrove snapper. Male and female mangrove snapper are externally indiscernible.Although the general ground color for this species may vary, especially in the case of juveniles, in general the body and fins of mangrove snappers are gray to green with a reddish tinge. There are also rows of small reddish to orange spots on the sides of this species. The median fins are darker than the paired fins, often edged with yellow or white and the pectoral fins are colorless. The back edge of the anal fin is rounded. There is no black spot on the side of body. Young mangrove snappers have a prominent dark stripe from the snout through the eye and a less conspicuous blue stripe on the cheek, below the eye.

    "identification": "The pelvic (ventral) fins are located relatively far back on the belly, about half way between the pectoral fins and the tail, instead of directly under the pectoral fins. The mouth is large with the maxillae reaching back at least to the middle of the eyes, and broad, like a ducks bill, but full of teeth.It can be distinguished from the pike and the pickerels by several factors. It may be barred, spotted, or have no markings at all, but any markings that do occur will be darker then the background of the body. The northern pike, by comparison, has light-colored, oblong spots against a darker body, and the chain pickerel has a unique chain-like pattern on the sides. The redfin and grass pickerels look much more like the musky in their markings, but they only grow to about 15 in. (38 cm) long. Another distinction occurs in the number of pores under the lower jaw. In the musky there are 6-9 along each side (rarely 5 or 10 on the side only).",

Also, the anal fin and rear edge of the dorsal fin of the lane snapper are not sharply pointed but appear to be squarish or even rounded. Of all the species of Lutjanidae having a dark spot on the flanks below the dorsal fin, the mutton snapper is the only one in which the tooth patch in the roof of the mouth has no median extension and resembles a crescent rather than an anchor shape.

Most noticeably the greenish or yellowish sides of the fish are covered with lighter colored oblong horizontal spots or streaks, whereas all other species have darker markings than the background color. The second distinction is the scale pattern on the gill cover and cheek. In the northern pike the cheek is fully scaled, but the bottom half of the gill cover is scaleless. In the larger muskellunge, both the bottom half of the gill cover and the bottom half of the cheek are fully scaled. The third distinctive feature is the number of pores under each side of the lower jaw; usually 5 in the northern pike (rarely 3,4, or 6 on one side), 6-9 in the muskellunge (rarely 5 or 10 on one side), and 4 in the smaller pickerels (occasionally 3 or 5 on one side only).",

When hooked it makes an initial long, fast run toward deep water, twisting and pausing to bump its head on the bottom or rub its mouth in the sand in an effort to disengage the hook. If there is coral, a sea fan, or any other obstacle on which the permit can snag the line, it will. To complicate matters, its mouth is as tough as shoe leather and it simply spits out the hook the first time there is any slack in the line.Fishing methods include casting to fish sighted in shallow water, bottom fishing, fishing over inshore wrecks, and jigging from boats or while wading. Baits and lures include crabs, shrimp, streamer flies, bonefish jigs, weighted bucktails, and plugs. Permit up to 8 or 10 pounds are considered excellent eating.

It will sometimes chase bait fish to the surface and smaller individuals are often seen milling about at the surface in large, tightly packed schools.

Color is typically blue to greenish dorsally, fading to silver laterally, with the ventral surface tending to be silvery and often yellow in color. There are no visible bars or stripes on the sides of pompano and the fins are dusky or yellowish in color, particularly the anal fin, which can be lemon yellow in small pompano. The dorsal fin has six spines that are set close to the body and there are 20-24 soft rays that originate behind the dorsal fin. The tail has a deep fork and is large in comparison to the body of the fish. The head profile slopes to a blunt snout, with the mouth towards the bottom of the snout, facing downward.",

Spawning occurs from spring through late fall and is generally assumed to take place offshore. Juvenile pompano can sometimes be found in brackish nursery areas with very low salinity however adult specimens can only be found in saltwater.Pompano will often spend their juvenile months in offshore waters but adults and some older juveniles prefer nearshore areas such as sloping beaches with sandy or muddy substrate, estuaries, shallow bays, piers and sand flats.

Most pompano can be found in very close to the shoreline on various beaches so even ordinary casting tackle, including spinning, baitcasting, and fly, will work just fine. The best bait to use is a live sand crab (often called a sand flea). Often times, anglers can dig into the sand right at the shoreline to gather enough sand crabs for a day’s worth of fishing. Live shrimp, dead sand crabs, clams and squid pieces will also work for natural bait. Artificial baits include small jigs, spoons, and pencil baits.

It is easily distinguished from other sharks by its teeth, which are smooth and have little cusps on each side of the base. It has a smaller secondary peduncle keel than the white shark. This smaller peduncle keel is located beneath the main keel but farther back on the tail. The first dorsal fin is farther forward than on the mako or white sharks. Its anal fin is directly beneath the second dorsal fin, whereas the mako’s anal fin originates near the midpoint of the second dorsal fin. It has a distinguishing white patch on the free-trailing base portion of the first dorsal fin.The dorsal and lateral sides of this shark are dark blue to gray in color. The first dorsal fin is dark with a white free rear tip, meaning the far rear of the dorsal fin is free swinging, and not connected to the body. This feature is the primary characteristic that distinguishes the porbeagle from the salmon, mako, and white sharks. The porbeagle shark is known to reach a length of 12 feet and weigh over 500 pounds.The fact that porbeagle sharks inhabit colder waters may account for the fact that there are no recorded instances of it ever attacking humans. The porbeagle is warm-blooded and ovoviviparous, having up to four pups measuring close to 20 inches long at birth.",

These fish range from a couple of pounds up to 15-20 pounds.Rainbow runners closely resemble the cobia in shape, but can be distinguished by its coloration as well as the finlet after the dorsal and anal fins. The back of the rainbow runner is blue-green. On each side there is a broad, dark blue, horizontal stripe near the back and one or two narrower, light blue stripes beneath the broader stripe. Between and around these blue stripes, the sides are cadmium yellow. The belly is white or silver, often with a yellow or pink tint.

As is typical of sunfishes, the redear has a small mouth, connected dorsal fins and a roundish, laterally compressed body. Its long, pointed, slightly falcate pectoral fins distinguish it from both the longear sunfish and the redbreast sunfish, which have short, round pectoral fins. The operculum is also much shorter than in the other two species and is black, with a red spot or margin at the tip. It can be distinguished from the similar looking pumpkinseed by the fact that its gill cover flap is semi-flexible and can be bent at least to right angles, whereas the flap on the pumpkinseed is rigid. It also lacks the spots on the dorsal fin and the bluish emerald lines on the sides of the head that are characteristic of the pumpkinseed. The body is slightly less compressed than that of the bluegill, which differs from the redear most noticeably in the fact that its gill cover flap is entirely black without any spot or trim.",

The body of the mountain whitefish, though almost cylindrical, is slightly compressed compared to the round whitefish. Coloration of the round whitefish is basically silvery, but the back is sepia brown to almost bronze with a greenish tinge. The scales, particularly on the back are edged with black. The lower fins are an amber shade becoming slightly more orange at spawning. The adipose fin is usually brown spotted. The round whitefish differs from all other North American whitefish and ciscoes in having only one flap between the openings of the nostrils, instead of two.",

The red color of the eyes associates this species with the redeye and Suwannee bass at first glance however morphologically, it is more closely related to the spotted bass. The shoal bass differs from the spotted bass by the absence of teeth on its tongue. The shoal bass also has more lateral line scales (usually 67-81), more rows of scales above (usually 8-10) and below (usually 15-21) the lateral line, and more caudal peduncle scales than the spotted bass. The color pattern of adult shoal bass is characterized by the presence of 10-15 midlateral and 6 to 8 supralateral dark vertical bars along the sides. These bars, which are also present in juveniles, easily distinguish the shoal bass from spotted bass. The redeye bass has an oval to rectangular patch of teeth on the tongue, fewer lateral line scales and fewer scale rows above and below the lateral line.The coloration of the shoal bass is olive green to dark olive to almost black. A dusky to black blotch is present on the posterior portion of the opercula and another one right before the tail. Three diagonal dark lines are present laterally on the head. The iris is typically bright red. Some have been known to reach more than eight pounds with the average size typically ranging around one to three pounds.",

The spotted gar and its close relative the Florida gar have spots on top of the head, over the entire body, and on all the fins. The spots on other gars are confined mainly to the rear portion of the bodies and on the fins, never on the head. The longnose gar is distinguished by its beak or snout which is 18-20 times as long as is at its narrowest point, a considerable greater length to width ratio than in other species. The beak of the shortnose gar is only about 5 1/2 times as long as its narrowest width.",

In the U.S. it can be found from northern Alabama to Oklahoma and down through Louisiana to the Gulf.

The coloration is also distinctive being usually more brownish in the smallmouth and more greenish in the largemouth.\nGenerally, the smallmouth has bars radiating back from the eyes, and though similar bars may be present in individuals of other species, including the largemouth, they seem to be more prominent and more consistently present in the smallmouth. A smallmouth's eyes are red or orangish. In young smallmouths, there is a distinctive band of orange at the base of the tail. This is followed by a black band with the tip of the tail being either white or yellow.\n",

It has been widely transplanted so that today it occurs in almost every state and many other countries. It is not as widespread as the largemouth bass.\nThey prefer deeper water than the largemouth and areas of clear, fast-flowing streams and pools with gravel/rubble bottom. In waters coinhabited by both smallmouth and largemouth, the largemouth bass will spawn a little earlier due to the fact that the shallower nesting sites they choose in protected areas with emergent vegetation warm to the optimum temperature sooner that the deeper, rockier sites chosen by the smallmouths.\nThe following list includes additional details on where to catch Smallmouth bass:\n",

The splake is difficult to identify externally because it resembles both parents in different aspects. The body shape is intermediate between the heavier lake trout and the slimmer brook trout. The shape of the tail is also a combination of the brook trout’s square tail and the lake trout’s more lunate tail. The tail of the splake is not as deeply forked as that of the lake trout, and more closely resembles the slightly indented tail of the brook trout. In coloration and makings, the splake more closely resembles the brook trout. It can be positively identified by the number of pyloric caeca, the worm-like appendages on the intestinal tract right after the stomach. The brook trout, which is the smaller parent, has only 23-55 (usually less than 50) pyloric caeca, while the intermediate-sized hybrid has 65-85, and the lake trout, the larger parent, has 93-208 caeca (most often 120-180).",

    "identification": "Many anglers who catch a spotted bass believe they have caught a largemouth bass, undoubtedly because the coloration is similar, both having a greenish hue and a broad stripe of diamonds or blotches along the midline of the body. The spotted bass, like all black basses except the largemouth, has scales on the base portion of the second dorsal fin, its first and second dorsal fin are clearly connected, and its upper jaw bone does not extend back to or beyond the rear edge of the eyes. The spotted bass is also often confused with the smallmouth bass, but lacks the vertical bars that are present on the sides of the body in the smallmouth. The spotted bass also has all black spots below the lateral line (the rear edges of certain scales are black) unlike either the largemouth or the smallmouth. Juveniles of the species resemble the young of smallmouth bass in having a broad band of orange at the base of the tail, followed by a broad black band and white edge. Because of the difficulty in recognizing the species, it is probable that record-size specimens of spotted bass have gone unnoticed.The smallmouth bass is known to hybridize in nature with the spotted bass, which could make identification of some specimens where both species are known to occur, even more difficult. Where depth permits, it appears that spotted bass usually stay deeper than smallmouths. In one lake in the TVA system in Tennessee, spotted bass have been taken at depths of up to 100 feet. Smallmouth bass, on the other hand, were not caught below 60 feet, and largemouth bass were always caught near the surface.",

      "description": "Spotted bass can be found throughout the central and lower Mississippi Basin to the Gulf of Mexico (from Texas to the Florida panhandle), including Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, and other nearby states where it occurs naturally or has been introduced. The Wichita spotted bass appears to be limited to the West Cache Creek, Oklahoma. The Alabama spotted bass has been introduced into California, however there are not substantial resident populations found there.

By contrast, the fish known as the rainbow trout will be much more colorful and live solely in freshwater. The steelhead and its closest relatives in the Pacific salmon group (cutthroat, golden, Mexican golden, Arizona native or Apache, and gila trouts) are known as the black-spotted trouts because they are covered with numerous prominent black spots. These spots may cover the entire body or may be more abundant near the tail. The spots characteristically extend onto the dorsal fin, the adipose fin, and the tail. Those on the tail radiate outward in an even, orderly pattern. Spots may or may not be present on any of the lower fins and there are never any red spots such as occur on freshwater and spawning specimens of brown trout and Atlantic salmon.Steelhead are a highly sought after species on the Pacific Coast and in the spring and summer, small runs of fish will average around two or three pounds. During the fall runs of steelhead, 10-15 pound fish are very common and they are known to reach weights of over 40 pounds.",

Some migrate from North Carolina, Virginia, or Maryland to more northern climates in the summer and return when the summer season is over.\nThe species moves far upstream in rivers during spawning migrations. In some of these waters populations have become landlocked due to artificial impoundments that blocked their return to the sea.

Adults lack scales and swordfish of all sizes lack ventral fins. The back may be dark brown, bronze, dark metallic purple, grayish blue or black. The sides may be dark like the back or dusky in color. The belly and lower sides of the head are dirty white or light brown.This pelagic, migratory species usually travels alone. It uses its sword for defense and to kill or stun food such as squid, dolphin, mackerel, bluefish and various other midwater and deep-see pelagic species. Occasional attacks on boats have been authenticated by the recovery of swords found broken off in wooden hulls. One swordfish attacked Alvin, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute submarine, at a depth of 2,000 feet and wedged its sword so tightly into a seam that it could not be withdrawn.",

      "description": "Fishing methods include presenting trolled baits or deep drifting at night with baits such as squid or bonito strips. They often bask on the surface with their dorsal and tail fins protruding from the water, making them susceptible to harpooners and longliners who make the majority of swordfish catches in the United States. They are finicky, easily frightened by an approaching boat, and rarely strike blindly. The bait must be presented carefully and repeatedly before the swordfish will take it. The soft mouth of the swordfish makes hookups uncertain and the slashing bill can make short work of an angler’s line or leader. To counteract the soft mouths of the swordfish, most anglers will set their drags lower than they would for most fish of this size. Squid is the most popular bait, though Spanish mackerel, eel, mullet, herring, tuna and live or dead bonito are also used.The flesh of a swordfish is considered by many to be one of the finest eating fish in the ocean. It has a firm texture and can be grilled, broiled or fried. Any angler wishing to target broadbill swordfish must first check any state and federal regulations for any necessary permits that may be required. In the United States, all anglers must possess a Highly Migratory Species Permit before landing any swordfish. The following are fishing methods used to catch this fish:",

A number of small teeth are present along the sides of the jaws and there are 2-3 large canine teeth in the tips. Young are generally brown or greenish brown with irregular dark mottling or blotching on the flanks. Larger specimens may be entirely black or charcoal gray, sometimes with greenish overtones, or they may be mottled with brown, black, or white. The belly and chin are white or gray and there may be spots on the chin. Females develop a white saddle down the middle of each side during spawning.",

Their diet is known to include mackerel, menhaden, garfish, needlefish and bluefish. Typically a thresher will slap or thrash the water with its tail to herd baitfish into a concentrated mass then use its tail to stun or injure individual fish before swallowing them. An angler may see his bait slapped out of the water then swallowed as it settles back in again, which is why threshers are often hooked in the tail. They are very active fighters when hooked and the longtail thresher has been known to leap clear out of the water. Fishing methods include trolling in marlin fashion or deep trolling and drifting, depending on the species to be caught.

The young characteristically have very prominent, dark brown tiger stripes and leopard spots on the upper body and tail, but adults have less prominent markings.This shark species is reported to be especially dangerous to humans because of its proneness to attack, and its tendency to occur in shallow water where people swim. It is a sluggish swimmer under normal conditions but comes alive in the presence of food which, considering the objects found in the stomachs of captured specimens, can be almost anything. In Australia and Florida this shark has been responsible for many fatal attacks. In just about all of the reported attacks, it was believed that the shark mistakenly attacked swimmers who resembled the tiger shark’s prey. Many divers have reported tiger shark sightings while underwater and most divers have described the tiger sharks’ behavior as quite docile.",

In shallow water at night, the eyes glow eerily under lights, readily identifying these fishes even before they can be seen.\nThe sauger can be distinguished by the markings on their dorsal fins. The walleye’s dorsal fin may be streaked, blotched, or plain, but lacks any clear spots and there is a prominent blotch at the posterior edge. On the sauger, the fin is spotted and lacks any large blotch at the back edge.

Conventional, spinning, and fly tackle may be used. They may also be taken from bridges, docks, and piers.

The most important identifying features are tooth shape and number, position of the dorsal fins, color, and the presence or absence of an interdorsal ridge on the sharks’ backs. Whalers are typically viviparous, with a yolk-sac placenta (tiger sharks are an exception, being ovoviviparous). The Carcarhinidae family contains three of the four shark species most dangerous to humans.Whalers are small to large sharks with fusiform bodies, round eyes, internal nictitating eyelids, ventrally placed mouths extending past the eyes, no nasal grooves or barbles, usually no spiracles (small holes behind the eyes), moderately long labial furrows, small to large blade-like teeth in both jaws (often broader in the upper jaw), and five gill openings with the fifth behind the origin of the pectoral fin. Whaler sharks also have two dorsal fins and an anal fin, with the first dorsal fin being moderate-sized to large, and have its base well ahead of the pelvic bases, the second dorsal fin usually much smaller than the first. They have precaudal pits and a caudal fin with a strong ventral lobe and lateral undulations on its dorsal margin. The intestine contains a scroll-type valve and usually lacks any color pattern.The 50+ species of sharks known as the requiem or whaler sharks are all solidly-built sharks with few obvious distinguishing features.",

It usually has numerous dark spots on the body, except in older individuals and spawning males.The surest way to identify the white catfish is to count the rays in the anal fin. The white catfish has 19-23 rays and the fin is rounded along the bottom edge. The channel catfish has 24-30 rays and also has a rounded anal fin. The blue catfish has a longer and much straighter edged anal fin with 30-36 rays.",

    "identification": "These fish have a streamlined body shape and a characteristic raised ridge exists along the midline of the belly between the vent and the base of the pelvic (ventral) fins. There is also a black spot at the base of the pectoral fin. The mouth is large, with a row of small teeth in the roof; the lower jaw projects slightly forward. Adult specimens are steel blue to gray above with golden highlights, and silvery below. Young fish up to about 18 inches may have 3-6 broad, dark vertical bars on the flanks, but these disappear with age.The white seabass may be taken by drift fishing or still fishing with live baits or by slow trolling, jigging, or casting with feathers or small, flashy metal lures. Heavier spinning and baitcasting outfits are usually the tackle of choice but light ocean gear is also useful. These fish commonly prey on sardines, anchovies, squid, small mackerel, and other small fishes and crustaceans.  The best fishing for white seabass is often at night using natural baits soaked near the bottom of the water column.The white seabass and its relatives are weakfishes. The name “weakfish” refers to the tender, easily torn mouth tissues characteristic of these fishes, not their fighting ability. “Seabass” and “seatrout” are misnomers for Atractoscion and Cynoscion species, which are not related to either bass or trout. These fish can grow very large to near 100 pounds but most common catches are in the 10-25 pound range.",

      "description": "The white seabass inhabits the eastern Pacific southward from Magdalena Bay, Mexico to Juneau, Alaska. They are usually found near the mainland shore over sandy bottoms or around and near kelp beds, but they may also be found in shallow surf or deeper waters.Most are caught near the mainland shore of California and around Catalina and San Clemente Islands just off the coast. Off of the coast of California, these fish are most plentiful from about May through September. The following list includes additional details on where to catch this fish:",

The great “white” shark is actually a grayish brown color above, fading to an off-white color on the belly.

It is known to occur as far north as Nova Scotia in the western Atlantic and northern Spain in the eastern Atlantic. In the winter it occurs south of Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and the West Indies. It is also known to enter the Mediterranean Sea.Though basically a deep water oceanic species, it does come in fairly close to shore off California because of the cool current and to feed on marine mammals. It also frequents Australian and South African beaches and is suspected of entering saltwater creeks. The following list includes additional details on where to catch this fish:",

The eyes are a brilliant yellow and raspy head spines are present in adult yelloweye rockfish. Juvenile coloration is so different that they were once described as a separate species. Juveniles have a rather dark background with a light stripe along the whole lateral line to the base of the caudal fin where the stripe divides at right angles to surround the caudal peduncle.

The pectoral fins in adults reach to the origin of the second dorsal fin, but never beyond the second dorsal fin to the finlets as in the albacore. The bigeye tuna T. obesus and the blackfin tuna T. atlanticus may have pectoral fins similar in length to those of the yellowfin. The yellow fin can be distinguished from the blackfin by the black margins on the finlets. Blackfin tuna, like albacore, have white margins on the finlets. It can be distinguished from the bigeye tuna by the lack of striations on the ventral surface of the liver.This is probably the most colorful of all the tunas. The back is blue-black, fading to silver on the lower flanks and belly. A golden yellow or iridescent blue strip runs from the eye to the tail, though this is not always prominent. All the fins and finlets are golden yellow though in some very large specimens the elongated dorsal and anal fins may be silver edged with yellow. The finlets have black edges.

It has a prominent, brilliant yellow stripe running from the tip of the snout through the eye to the tail; the dorsal fin is also mostly yellow. The deeply forked tail is bright yellow, hence the name.Adult yellowtail snappers may reach a maximum length of 30 inches. This fish rarely exceeds weights of 5 pounds and sexual maturity is attained at lengths of 10-12 inches. Life expectancy is typically 6-14 years.Although most teeth in the upper jaw are densely packed, fine, or hair like \"villiform\" teeth, there are several canine teeth present as well – the latter constituting a definitive characteristic of all snappers. The lower jaw, which projects slightly beyond the upper, has larger villiform teeth.",

      "description": "In the western Atlantic, yellowtail snapper range from Massachusetts and Bermuda to southwestern Brazil; including the Gulf of Mexico. They are very scarce in the northern reaches of their range but are very abundant in the Bahamas, southern Florida and throughout the Caribbean.Yellowtail inhabit coastal waters to a depth of 300 ft and are mainly found associated with coral reefs. It can be found well above the bottom in loose schools or alone. The following list includes additional details on where to catch this fish:",

      "description": "A common approach to catching yellowtail snapper is chumming while at anchor. These finicky feeders are attracted to the chum and then fished with live or cut bait; even plugs and flies. Many of the largest yellowtails are caught bottom fishing in deep water with live pilchards or other baitfish, even large ballyhoo. Adult yellowtail snappers are primarily nocturnal predators. They feed on benthic organisms including crabs, shrimp, cephalopods, worms, and fish. Juveniles, living primarily among sea grasses, feed on plankton.
